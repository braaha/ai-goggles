Fast-Forward Summary:

The prototype we developed is AI goggles to help monitor individuals with neurobehavioral injury. The goggles help us to understand factors in daily life that impact people recovering from spinal injury, strokes, and substance use. The glasses work by recording visual and audio data, and potentially eye tracking. Our prototypes record data through cameras and sensors attached to the frame. The data is then sent to a mobile app that securely transmits the data to a server that uses AI to analyze it.
